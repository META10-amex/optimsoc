# Output the OpTiMSoC version number of the current source tree
#
# The script tries to give the version number as accurate as possible to 
# enable others to reproduce the exact same state of the source code.
#
# Rules: 
# - If the repository state equals a tagged release version, return that
#   version number.
# - If modifications have been made on top of the released version, the
#   version number is appended with "-git<COMMITID>"
# - If the working directory has local modifications, it is further appended
#   with a "+" sign.
# - If no tagged release can be found, only the commit ID is returned.
# - Finally, if the code is not inside a git repository, "unknown" is returned.
#
